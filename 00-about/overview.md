# About this course

The aim of this course is to write an interpreter to
an arbitrary, simple language. Students shall write
their own implementations of lexical analyzer, syntactic analyzer
and interpreter.

Main focus of this course will be small sized project
managment. Students will be introduced to the build systems,
software testing methods as well, partitioning project files
between libraries, code documentation, etc.

What's more some programming paradigms will be introduced.
Functional, imperative and object oriented programming will
be overviewd.

No actuall theory about lexycal or syntax analyze will
be explored in details as the chosen project theme is just
there to allow students to use techniques introduced in
this course in some real project.

## For whom

This course was prapered for the students of the second
and the third year students of the Staszic Highschool in Warsaw.

That in itself is important as the materials that can be found
in this repository are just supplements to the lectures
that won't be included.

## About this repository

Each directory in this repository corresponds to sigle lecture.
Directories are numbered starting at `00` on this lesson and following
with `01`. Following examples build on the previous ones, so its important
to look on them in sequence.

Beside example files there will me one file like this one.
Named `overview.md`, written in markdown, containing comprehensive
look at the example as well as some of the teoretical basics.

Overview files are not equalivent to the lecture before the lesson starts.

## About examples

All of following lessons build upon itself sok all of them use
the same technology stack. Code is written in `C++17` and
compiled with `CMake` and `clang 9.0.0` compiler.

Examples were written, compiled and run on linux (`Ubuntu 18.04`).

Students might use Windows or different compiler if they so desire,
but need to be aware that the help provided during lessons might be
limited.
